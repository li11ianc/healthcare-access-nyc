# %>% it Up! :: Healthcare Inequality in the Age of COVID-19

## Project Overview

Since the middle of March, life in the United States has been largely upended due to the prevalence and rate of progression of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The federal government along with state governors have led the charge in protecting the American people from the uncertainty of this pandemic and have been saving lives. 

As with other extreme events in world history, this pandemic has shed light on existing inequalities in the United States, as well as the rest of the world. U.S. health policies have made strides in leveling these inequities, but there are still nationwide inconsistencies in healthcare experiences and outcomes. These landmark healthcare reform laws have improved patient experience and expanded access to many citizens who were previously excluded from coverage. However, the federal-state partnerships give many states leeway in terms of how they determine who is eligible for these government assistance programs. Although many more people have insurance than before, it can still be seen that there is a long way to go before access is not only affordable, but also equitable. 

Our project aims to put these disparities in the context of the coronavirus. We begin by looking at the healthcare system generally across states, then more closely examine the New York metropolitan area, a coronavirus hot spot. A variety of metrics including effectiveness, timeliness of care and patient experience will be used to assess the quality of the healthcare system. Finally, we will look at Medicaid spending and enrollment to understand if there exist any difficult in access for underprivileged populations.
